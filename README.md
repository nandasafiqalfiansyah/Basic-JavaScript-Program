## Variables

Variables are used to store and refer to values. In this program, we will learn how to declare variables using the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords.

## Data Types

JavaScript has several built-in data types such as `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, and more. In this program, we will explore examples of using these data types.

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on values, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. This program will demonstrate the usage of various operators.

## Conditionals

Conditionals are used to execute specific blocks of code based on given conditions. This program will explain the usage of conditionals with simple examples.

## Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. This program will provide examples of using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## Functions

Functions are used to group a block of code that can be called repeatedly. In this program, we will learn how to define and call functions in JavaScript.

## Event Handling

JavaScript is also used to handle user interactions on web pages, such as button clicks or form submissions. This program will demonstrate examples of event handling in JavaScript.
